    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
        <p>The Sylkith are small, agile creatures with features that blend the delicate, fine-boned elegance of elves and the reptilian traits of kobolds. They have pointed ears and bright, almond-shaped eyes, but their skin is scaled, shimmering in various shades of green and blue. They have tails, though shorter and more flexible than those of typical kobolds, which aid in their incredible balance and agility.</p>

    <section id="environment">
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>The Sylkith inhabit the dense, enchanted forests of Mirathal, living in treetop villages crafted from the living wood of ancient trees. These forests are filled with a magical mist that seems to shimmer with a life of its own, nurturing and protecting all who dwell within.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Sylkith society is a blend of kobold cunning and Elvish grace. They are masters of trap-making and guerrilla warfare, defending their homes fiercely from any intruders. Their social structure is clan-based, with a matriarch or patriarch leading each clan. Art, music, and storytelling are vital aspects of their culture, with each clan having its own set of tales and songs passed down through generations.</p>
