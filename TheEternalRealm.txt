**The Eternal Realm**

The Eternal Realm is a war-ravaged, sorrow-filled dimensional plane where combat is an unyielding constant, and peace is nothing more than a forgotten myth. The realm exists in a perpetual state of conflict, with the clashing sounds of weapons, the cries of the fallen, and the ever-present scent of blood hanging thick in the air. It is a place where war has no end, and the horrors of battle are eternal. Time itself seems to stretch and break under the weight of endless skirmishes, as if the very concept of tranquility has been expunged from this plane’s fabric.

The landscape of the Eternal Realm is a desolate wasteland, littered with the remains of ancient fortresses, shattered cities, and endless battlefields. The terrain is scarred by deep craters, broken roads, and jagged mountains that rise from the ashes of past wars. Rivers run black with the blood of countless soldiers who have perished in the endless wars. The sky is perpetually overcast, casting an oppressive gloom over the land, while the air is filled with the echoes of violence—war cries, the clash of steel, and the screams of those who are left to suffer.

In this dimension, the inhabitants are bound to the war, as though cursed to fight forever. Factions constantly battle for dominance, each one locked in its own bitter conflict. These factions range from corrupted empires to savage warbands, all fueled by hatred and the desire for conquest. The fighting is not restricted to organized armies—bands of marauding individuals, monstrous beasts, and otherworldly horrors participate in the slaughter, driven by primal instincts and insatiable bloodlust.

The warriors of the Eternal Realm are locked in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, their souls bound to the battlefield. When they fall, their bodies may be shattered and their lives extinguished, but their spirits are drawn back to the war, reincarnated to fight once more. Each death is a tragedy, but also an opportunity for vengeance or glory, as the fallen rise again with no memory of their previous life, only the impulse to fight. For many, the concept of life outside the war is foreign, and those who remember a time before the endless bloodshed are rare, often hunted down by their own kin as traitors to the cause.

The sorrow that pervades this realm is palpable. Every corner of the Eternal Realm is a monument to loss—families torn apart, kingdoms destroyed, and dreams turned to dust. There is no joy here, only the cruel irony that every victory in battle is fleeting, for the war never ends. Even the mightiest of warriors are eventually worn down by the never-ending cycle of conflict. The suffering is not just physical, but emotional and psychological, as those who remain begin to lose themselves to the violence. Mental anguish is a constant companion, as minds crack under the pressure of endless war and the heavy weight of grief.

The Eternal Realm is also a realm of terrible, sorrowful entities—beasts and spirits that feed off the pain and loss of those caught within its bounds. These entities stalk the battlefields, hunting for souls to torment and drag into the depths of the conflict. Some are monstrous horrors, their bodies twisted by the horrors of the war, while others are once-human spirits who have been corrupted by the violence around them. These beings are drawn to the sorrow, feeding off it, and often serve as instruments of terror and torment, adding to the endless suffering that plagues the realm.

Factions in the Eternal Realm are bound by one principle: there is only war. Alliances are fragile and temporary, formed only when necessary to combat a common enemy. Betrayal is common, and trust is a rare commodity. Even the strongest alliances are shattered by the thirst for power and vengeance, leading to constant shifts in the battlefield. Some factions seek to end the war, though few truly believe that peace is possible in such a place. Most simply desire to control the chaos, to dominate their enemies and secure their place in the ever-shifting tides of conflict.

The Eternal Realm is a plane of sorrow and destruction, where hope is crushed underfoot by the weight of endless war. To exist here is to live in constant agony, torn between the desire for survival and the inevitability of death. It is a place where the line between right and wrong blurs, where morality is lost in the bloodshed, and where every victory is a temporary reprieve before the next battle begins. It is a realm for those who seek glory in battle or wish to escape the war only to find themselves swallowed by its eternal maelstrom. Peace is impossible here, for the Eternal Realm is a world where the drums of war never cease and sorrow is the only companion left to those who fight.
