        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>The Illisks are a serpent-like species with long, sinuous bodies covered in matte black or deep purple scales that shimmer with an ethereal glow under moonlight. Their eyes are striking, glowing with an unnatural silver or deep violet hue. Their elongated bodies allow for exceptional flexibility, making them expert climbers, swimmers, and stealthy infiltrators. Their mouths are lined with sharp, retractable fangs, used both as a means of defense and for delivering poisons. They have no limbs, relying on their serpentine bodies to maneuver through the world with incredible speed and grace. Their heads are often adorned with markings or tattoos that signify rank within their tribes or serve as symbols of devotion to their dark deities.</p>

        <h2>Culture and Society</h2>
        <p>The Illisks are a nomadic and secretive species, living in small tribes that wander the most dangerous and desolate regions of the world. They are primarily assassins and thieves, raised from birth to serve as instruments of death, espionage, and subterfuge. Their culture is built around cunning, deception, and ruthless efficiency, valuing intelligence and subtlety above all else. They rarely form permanent settlements, instead establishing hidden encampments that are abandoned once they attract too much attention. The Illisks' ties to The Darkness and The Void are central to their beliefs and way of life, and they view these entities as both patrons and punishers.</p>

    <section id="beliefs-worship">
        <h2>Beliefs and Worship</h2>
        <p>The Illisks worship <strong>The Darkness</strong> and <strong>The Void</strong>, seeing them as the ultimate sources of power, mystery, and the unknown. The Darkness is perceived as a force that devours light, representing the hidden knowledge and secrets of the universe. The Void, in turn, is seen as the cosmic emptiness from which all life and matter originate and to which they will eventually return. To the Illisks, The Darkness offers the gift of stealth, while The Void grants them the power to erase their existence when the time comes. They believe that they are part of a grand cosmic design, and that their role in the world is to bring balance by removing the unwanted, the corrupt, and the weak.</p>

    <section id="dark-past">
        <h2>Dark Past and Secrecy</h2>
        <p>The Illisks' past is something that few dare to explore. Most of their history is buried in darkness, with only a handful of ancient texts and cryptic symbols remaining. It is said that their ancestors once made a dark pact with an ancient being or force of great power, a being that now resides in the Void. This pact granted the Illisks their abilities and long life, but it also cursed them with a never-ending thirst for darkness. The truth of this pact is feared, as some believe that uncovering it could lead to the species' downfall.</p>
