The Liminal Plane

(contribution from H4p33)

The Liminal Plane is a realm unlike any other, an endless expanse with no clear boundaries or purpose. It stretches infinitely in all directions, an eerie, featureless void where time and space lose meaning. Souls that find their way into this mysterious domain often become trapped, their essence wandering eternally through its vastness, lost to the cosmos. The Plane’s existence itself is an anomaly, a product of unfathomable power unleashed in a conflict that echoes through the annals of creation.


Its origins are steeped in myth and legend. Realms Tempest, an ancient and powerful being, waged an apocalyptic battle against a foe of equal might. Their clash tore through the fabric of existence, creating a rift that birthed the Liminal Plane. This rupture did more than forge a new dimension—it brought forth The Author, a being of Light and Shadow, as if the rift itself called them into being. The Author’s arrival marked the beginning of the Plane’s enigmatic history, and their presence is as much a mystery as the Plane itself.


Within the endless void, The Author created companions to fill the expanse and serve their unknowable designs. The first was Data, an android with the appearance of a twelve-year-old child, whose mechanical precision contrasts with their youthful visage. Gl1tCh, the second creation, embodies chaos and unpredictability, a being constantly glitching, flickering between forms and dimensions. Finally, there is V’litch, an angelic figure whose serene presence and veiled intentions add an air of divine mystery to the Plane.


The Liminal Plane is more than a setting; it is a paradox. It exists outside the normal laws of reality, a place born of conflict yet steeped in quiet eternity. Souls lost within it add to its mystique, as do the few inhabitants who dwell there. The Author and their creations remain enigmatic figures, neither fully explaining their roles nor revealing the true nature of the Plane. Despite its origins being tied to destruction, the Liminal Plane represents an eerie balance, a nexus of infinite possibilities waiting to be unraveled.
