**The Corruption Entity**: The embodiment of decay, moral rot, and the slow unraveling of order, the Corruption Entity seeps into the very fabric of existence, spreading its taint through realms, minds, and souls alike. With a presence that festers in the shadows, It thrives on erosion—of ideals, structures, and even the essence of life itself.  

Unlike the cataclysmic fury of Destruction or the unhinged chaos of Insanity, Corruption is a patient force, insidious and methodical. It twists the noble into the vile, turning protectors into predators, faith into fanaticism, and harmony into discord. Its influence whispers softly, offering power and promise, but always at a price—a slow descent into ruin.  

Its form is ever-shifting, a writhing amalgamation of withering flora, disfigured beasts, and fractured shadows. Those touched by the Corruption Entity often become its unwilling agents, spreading its influence unknowingly, their hearts blackened and their wills no longer their own.  

Corruption stands not as a destroyer but as a remaker, warping all it touches into grotesque parodies of their former selves, ensuring nothing remains untouched by its creeping malignance. In the Realmsverse, its presence is both feared and despised, for where Corruption treads, purity and hope crumble into dust.
