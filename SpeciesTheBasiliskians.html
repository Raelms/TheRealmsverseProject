        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>Basiliskians are a serpentine-like species with long, coiling bodies covered in smooth, iridescent scales that shift in color based on their mood and environment. Their heads are adorned with crest-like spines, and their eyes glow with a faint golden hue. Their limbs are minimal, with two clawed arms that are used for wielding weapons or interacting with the environment. They possess remarkable agility and flexibility, making them efficient in combat or stealth missions. Their voice is smooth and hypnotic, often used to charm or intimidate their targets.</p>

        <h2>Culture and Society</h2>
        <p>The Basiliskians are a nomadic species, with no centralized government or singular homeland. They roam vast stretches of land, often traversing deserts or jungles. Despite their lack of advanced technology, they are highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, archery, and the use of poisonous substances. The Basiliskians are known to hire themselves out as mercenaries, offering their services in exchange for gold, resources, or favors. However, they are bound by a strict code of conduct that governs their work and interactions.</p>

    <section id="code-of-conduct">
        <h2>Code of Conduct – The Code of the Serpent</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Honor the Contract:</strong> Once a Basiliskian accepts a contract, they are bound to see it through to completion, regardless of the challenges that may arise. Failure to fulfill a contract brings dishonor to their name and their clan. They value personal integrity and will never abandon a client, unless that client has broken the terms of the contract first.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect the Payment:</strong> Payment is sacred to the Basiliskians. Once the agreed-upon compensation is made, it must be honored. If a client attempts to cheat or shortchange a Basiliskian, retaliation will be swift and sure, but only within the bounds of their contract. A Basiliskian will never attack a client without reason or without provocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutrality in Conflicts:</strong> A Basiliskian does not take sides unless it benefits them directly. They do not involve themselves in the politics of their employers, unless it is stipulated in their contract. They operate solely as mercenaries and believe that maintaining neutrality in personal affairs ensures a fair, unbiased deal for both parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Before Dishonor:</strong> If a Basiliskian’s honor is ever questioned, they will fight to the death to prove their loyalty and commitment. They believe in maintaining their reputation above all else and will never allow slander or insults to go unchallenged. An offense against their code is considered an offense against the whole species.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect for All Life:</strong> While they are mercenaries by trade, the Basiliskians do not kill indiscriminately. They believe that every life has value, and will only take a life if it is part of a contract or self-defense. They abhor senseless violence and prefer to incapacitate rather than kill when possible.</li>
            <li><strong>No Unnecessary Favors:</strong> Basiliskians do not offer favors without compensation. A debt owed is a debt to be paid. They do not lend their services or resources out of friendship or goodwill but will expect equal value in return. Favors are strictly transactional, and those who try to cheat a Basiliskian out of a favor will find their trust hard to regain.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect for the Elders:</strong> Each Basiliskian clan has its elders, who are deeply respected for their wisdom and experience. These elders are consulted in matters of major importance, such as making peace with rival clans, resolving disputes, or interpreting the code when unclear situations arise. Disrespect towards the elders is seen as a grave offense.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combat Expertise:</strong> Though lacking advanced technology, the Basiliskians have mastered the use of simple, yet deadly, weapons like poisoned blades, whips, and bows.</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth and Agility:</strong> Their serpentine bodies allow them to move silently and quickly, making them excellent at ambushes and covert operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Alchemical Knowledge:</strong> They have a deep knowledge of toxins, poisons, and herbal remedies, which they often incorporate into their weaponry or defensive tactics.</li>
            <li><strong>Mercenary Networks:</strong> Basiliskians are organized into clans that often operate as informal guilds. They exchange information, resources, and contacts, ensuring that a Basiliskian can always find a contract if they need one.</li>
