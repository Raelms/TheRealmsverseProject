Their eyes glow with an eerie, otherworldly radiance, and their maws are filled with rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending through starships and celestial bodies alike. Long, sinuous tendrils extend from their heads, each tipped with a menacing barb that they use to ensnare prey and tear apart their victims.</p>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>Void Eaters are apex predators, feared by all who traverse the depths of space. They possess an insatiable hunger for energy and matter, consuming stars, planets, and entire galaxies in their quest for sustenance.
