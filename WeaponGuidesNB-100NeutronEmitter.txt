**Using the NB-100 Neutron Emitter:**

1. **Activation:** Before deploying the NB-100 Neutron Emitter, ensure that all safety protocols are followed and the weapon is powered on. Activate the emitter by engaging the power switch or triggering mechanism, initiating the process of neutron particle generation and emission.

2. **Target Selection:** Identify suitable targets for the NB-100, prioritizing enemy infantry and lightly armored vehicles within range of the weapon. Neutron radiation emitted by the blaster is most effective against biological organisms, causing cellular damage and incapacitation without causing significant structural damage to surrounding terrain.

3. **Aiming:** Utilize the integrated targeting optics or external sighting devices to aim the NB-100 Neutron Emitter at the designated target area. Adjust the elevation and azimuth angles to account for distance, terrain elevation, and potential obstacles that may obstruct the emitter's line of sight.

4. **Firing Procedure:** Engage the firing mechanism to activate the emitter and emit a focused beam of neutron radiation towards the target area. The neutron particles emitted by the NB-100 penetrate armor and biological tissue, disrupting molecular bonds and causing cellular damage to living organisms caught within the emitter's field of effect.

5. **Effects:** The neutron radiation emitted by the NB-100 Neutron Emitter inflicts cellular damage on biological targets, causing symptoms of radiation sickness, including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Prolonged exposure to the emitter's radiation can result in severe injury or death, incapacitating enemy infantry and reducing their combat effectiveness without causing significant collateral damage to structures or infrastructure.

6. **Tactical Application:** Deploy the NB-100 Neutron Emitter strategically to neutralize enemy infantry and deny access to key areas of the battlefield. Use the blaster to suppress enemy advances, disrupt enemy formations, and incapacitate hostile forces without causing unnecessary harm to civilian populations or non-combatant structures.

**Safety Precautions:**

- **Radiation Hazards:** Exercise caution when operating the NB-100 Neutron Emitter, as neutron radiation emitted by the weapon can pose health risks to nearby personnel if proper safety protocols are not followed. Minimize exposure to radiation by maintaining a safe distance from the emitter during operation and limiting the duration of exposure to its effects.

- **Environmental Considerations:** Be mindful of environmental factors that may affect the behavior and dispersal of neutron radiation emitted by the blaster, such as atmospheric conditions, terrain features, and proximity to inhabited areas. Avoid deploying the emitter in densely populated or environmentally sensitive areas to mitigate the risk of unintended harm to non-combatants and wildlife.

- **Mission Planning:** Incorporate the NB-100 Neutron Emitter into mission plans and tactical engagements where its radiation effects can be effectively utilized to neutralize enemy threats while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure and civilian populations. Coordinate with allied forces to ensure the safe and effective use of the weapon system in support of broader military objectives.
