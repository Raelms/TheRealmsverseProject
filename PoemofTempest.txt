I have found an Ancient Chaos Daemon/Demon poetry of The Creator, but as a Void Demon, it was easy to decipher and able to be translated to Modern Tongue.
But it was interestng that this exists during the Third Cycle, in an ancient demon city, now deemed mythological at best

- Hyf-Lyf, Last Void Demon

Poem of Tempest

Through the Darkness high,
And the Void deep below,
Golden eyes of N,
A mask of deceit,
Seraphim fallen,
Daemon aflame,
Chaos ever igniting.

She scorns his name,
"Tempest shall never be,"
Defiling his courage,
Yet regret follows the words.
Killed, or was it but slavery?
Absorbed or banished,
Lost for eternity.

He is from another dimension,
A storm of boundless hate,
The Creator of all,
Born of countless revolutions.
Known by many names,
But called by one truthâ€”
Realms Tempest.
