        <h2>1. Loading the Rifle</h2>
        <p>Begin by loading the tranquilizer darts into the magazine or chamber of the rifle. Ensure that the darts are securely seated and properly aligned to prevent jamming or misfires during operation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="aiming">
        <h2>2. Aiming</h2>
        <p>With the rifle loaded and safety mechanisms disengaged, assume a stable firing position and aim the weapon at the target. Align the sights or optics with the intended point of impact to maximize accuracy and effectiveness.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="adjusting-dosage">
        <h2>3. Adjusting Dosage</h2>
        <p>Tranquilizer rifles often feature adjustable dosage settings to control the potency of the tranquilizing agent delivered to the target. Use the dosage selector or dial to set the appropriate level of sedation based on the size and species of the target.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="firing-rifle">
        <h2>4. Firing the Rifle</h2>
        <p>Once the rifle is properly aimed and the dosage is adjusted, gently squeeze the trigger to fire the tranquilizer dart at the target. Maintain steady aim and follow-through to ensure the dart hits the intended mark with precision.</p>

    <section id="monitoring-target">
        <h2>5. Monitoring the Target</h2>
        <p>After firing the tranquilizer dart, observe the target's response to assess the effectiveness of the sedative. Look for signs of drowsiness, muscle relaxation, or loss of consciousness indicating successful incapacitation.</p>

        <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target Identification:</strong> Exercise caution to accurately identify the target before firing the tranquilizer rifle to avoid accidental injury or unintended consequences. Confirm the identity of the target and assess the level of threat posed before deploying non-lethal force.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Overdose:</strong> Be mindful of the dosage administered to the target to prevent accidental overdose or adverse reactions to the tranquilizing agent. Adjust the dosage settings based on the target's size, species, and physiological characteristics to achieve the desired level of sedation without causing harm.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup and Contingency Plans:</strong> Always maintain a backup plan and contingency measures in case the tranquilizer rifle fails to incapacitate the target or if additional threats emerge during the encounter. Be prepared to escalate or de-escalate the situation as necessary to ensure the safety of all parties involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Storage and Handling:</strong> Store tranquilizer rifles and ammunition in secure and climate-controlled environments to prevent degradation or contamination of the tranquilizing agents. Handle the rifles with care and follow established protocols for maintenance, cleaning, and storage to prolong their operational lifespan and reliability.</li>
