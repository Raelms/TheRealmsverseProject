116. **Relox** – An arid, rocky world that has been colonized by humans who live in large, interconnected biosphere installations that support both agriculture and industry.

117. **Oryx II** – This resource-rich world is habitable only within biospheres, as the planet’s surface is too hostile for direct human exposure. Mining operations flourish under the controlled conditions.

118. **Nelexa** – A planet with extremely high gravity, Nelexa’s colonies exist under extreme conditions, with artificial support systems allowing humans to live and work within domed habitats.

119. **Ylron III** – With its thin atmosphere and lack of natural water sources, Ylron III has been colonized using biosphere domes that provide all the necessities for human life.

120. **Jirath Prime** – Initially an uninhabitable planet, Jirath Prime has become an agricultural hub, with crops growing inside massive biospheres that regulate temperature, humidity, and air quality.

121. **Tholaris IV** – A volcanic world, Tholaris IV’s colonists live within shielded habitats that protect them from both volcanic eruptions and the toxic atmosphere.

122. **Zyrex** – A harsh desert planet that relies on a network of interconnected biospheres to support human life. The planet has been slowly adapted for farming and habitation.

123. **Xenara VII** – Marginally habitable, Xenara VII has seen human colonization under controlled biospheres, which provide safety from the planet’s frequent storms and erratic climate.

124. **Kelris** – With its thin and toxic atmosphere, Kelris has been colonized by humans who live in tightly controlled dome environments that provide clean air and water.

125. **Torvalis** – A rocky world with limited oxygen, Torvalis has been colonized using artificial biosphere habitats that provide homes, industry, and a stable environment for long-term human habitation.
