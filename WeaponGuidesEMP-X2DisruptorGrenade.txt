**Using the EMP-X2 Disruptor Grenade:**

1. **Activation:** Before deploying the EMP-X2 Disruptor Grenade, ensure that the safety pin is removed and the grenade is armed. The activation mechanism is typically a simple twist or pull mechanism, depending on the grenade's design.

2. **Throwing Technique:** Employ standard grenade throwing techniques to accurately deliver the EMP-X2 to the desired target area. Use an overhand or underhand throwing motion, adjusting the angle and force of the throw based on the distance to the target and environmental conditions.

3. **Detonation:** Upon impact or after a preset time delay, the EMP-X2 Disruptor Grenade detonates, releasing a powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in all directions. The blast radius of the EMP affects electronic devices and systems within its range, disrupting their functionality and rendering them temporarily inoperable.

4. **Effects:** The EMP blast from the grenade fries circuits, overloads sensors, and disrupts communication systems, causing chaos and confusion among enemy forces reliant on technology. Energy-based weapons and shields may also be temporarily disabled by the EMP, leaving enemy combatants vulnerable to follow-up attacks.

5. **Tactical Application:** Use the EMP-X2 Disruptor Grenade strategically to neutralize enemy technology and gain a tactical advantage on the battlefield. Target enemy vehicles, drones, and fortified positions with electronic systems to disrupt their operations and create openings for allied forces to exploit.

**Safety Precautions:**

- **Friendly Fire Risk:** Exercise caution when deploying EMP grenades in close proximity to friendly forces, as the blast radius of the EMP can affect allied electronic systems as well. Communicate your intentions and coordinate with teammates to minimize the risk of inadvertently disabling friendly equipment.

- **Limited Duration:** Keep in mind that the effects of the EMP-X2 Disruptor Grenade are temporary, and electronic systems may recover functionality once the electromagnetic interference subsides. Coordinate follow-up attacks or maneuvers to capitalize on the disruption caused by the grenade and maintain pressure on the enemy.

- **Environmental Considerations:** Be aware of environmental factors that may affect the effectiveness of the EMP blast, such as terrain features, obstacles, and electromagnetic interference from natural sources. Adapt your tactics and positioning to maximize the impact of the grenade and minimize unintended consequences.
