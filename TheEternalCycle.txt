### **The Eternal Cycle**  

In the Realmsverse, time itself operates on a grand, self-sustaining cycle known as **The Eternal Cycle**â€”a never-ending loop of creation, growth, decay, and eventual rebirth. This cycle governs the lifespan of entire dimensions, reflecting their rise, transformation, and renewal across immeasurable epochs.

### **Structure of The Eternal Cycle**  

#### **The 12 Eras**  
Each cycle is divided into **12 Eras**, representing the overarching themes and major cosmic events that define the existence of a dimension. Each Era is distinct, and while the events of one Era influence the next, the cycle as a whole ultimately resets upon completion.  

#### **The Four Ages of Each Era**  
Each Era is further broken into **Four Ages**, which represent the phases of the Era's progression. These Ages are:  

1. **The Age of Genesis**: The dimension is born or reborn, vibrant and filled with untapped potential. Creation thrives, and civilizations emerge.  
2. **The Age of Ascension**: Growth and expansion define this age. Societies reach their zenith, and knowledge flourishes.  
3. **The Age of Decline**: Entropy and conflict take hold. Wars, corruption, or natural cataclysms herald the approaching end of the Era.  
4. **The Age of Twilight**: The dimension begins its inevitable collapse. Structures fail, reality warps, and the Era fades into nothingness, only for the cycle to begin anew.  

#### **Years in an Age**  
Each Age lasts for **1,000 years**, making each Era span **4,000 years**. Thus, the complete Eternal Cycle encompasses **48,000 years** before the dimension experiences its rebirth.

### **Philosophical and Cultural Impact**  

The Eternal Cycle is a source of reverence and dread across the Realmsverse. Many cultures see it as divine, a testament to the inevitability of life, death, and rebirth. Others view it with existential despair, striving to delay the inevitable Twilight.  

Among scholars and mystics, it is believed that each cycle carries echoes of the previous one, influencing the dimension's rebirth. This gives rise to debates about whether the Cycle can ever truly be broken or transcended.  

In their endless dance through creation and destruction, the realms and their inhabitants play their parts, knowing that no matter how bright or dark their Age, it is but one chapter in the Eternal Cycle.
