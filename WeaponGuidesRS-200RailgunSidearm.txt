**Using the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm:**

1. **Activation:** Activate the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm by depressing the power switch located near the grip. The weapon will emit a low hum as it charges up, indicating that it is ready to fire.

2. **Grip and Stance:** Hold the railgun sidearm with a firm grip using your dominant hand, ensuring that your fingers are positioned comfortably around the grip. Use your non-dominant hand to support the weapon and stabilize your aim. Assume a stable shooting stance, with your feet shoulder-width apart and your body weight evenly distributed.

3. **Aiming:** Align the front sight of the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm with the rear sight, focusing your attention on the target. Keep both eyes open to maintain situational awareness while aiming. Adjust your aim as needed to ensure that the sights are centered on the intended target.

4. **Trigger Control:** Apply gradual pressure to the trigger of the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm until it reaches the firing point. The weapon will discharge an armor-piercing kinetic round once the trigger is fully depressed. Avoid jerking or flinching during the trigger pull, as this can affect your accuracy and control.

5. **Firing:** Fire the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm in short, controlled bursts to conserve ammunition and maintain accuracy. Keep the weapon steady and maintain your sight picture throughout each firing sequence. Monitor the ammunition counter on the weapon's display to ensure that you do not run out of rounds during combat.

6. **Reloading:** Reload the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm by ejecting the spent magazine and inserting a fresh one into the weapon's magazine well. Ensure that the magazine is fully seated and locked in place before resuming firing.

**Safety Precautions:**

- **Muzzle Awareness:** Always keep the muzzle of the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm pointed in a safe direction to prevent accidental discharges and minimize the risk of injury to yourself and others. Avoid pointing the weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.

- **Finger Off the Trigger:** Keep your finger off the trigger of the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm until you are ready to fire. This helps prevent accidental discharges and ensures that you maintain control over the weapon at all times.

- **Safe Storage:** When not in use, store the RS-200 Railgun Sidearm in a secure holster or weapon rack to prevent unauthorized access and ensure safe handling. Keep the weapon out of reach of children and unauthorized personnel to prevent accidents or misuse.
