### **The Exodus**  

The Sabakanovyians hailed from a dimension where hybrids of all kinds populated the lands. They were an oppressed people, forced into slavery under tyrannical masters. Their origin dimension was a place of grandeur but deeply fractured, marked by brutal hierarchies and endless conflict.  

**The Great Revolt:**  
The Sabakanovyians, under Vae’s leadership, rebelled against their masters during a period of devastating war. The revolt was both bold and desperate, fueled by the dream of freedom. Their uprising coincided with the kingdom’s collapse, brought on by the masters' inability to sustain their war efforts and suppress the rebellion simultaneously.  

**The Forced Exile:**  
As the kingdom fell into ruin, the Sabakanovyians seized ships capable of dimensional travel. Though they did not know where they would end up, their desire to escape the hardships of their world was unwavering. With dwindling supplies, they leapt into the unknown, eventually arriving in the 22nd Dimension.  

**Arrival in the 22nd Dimension:**  
The Sabakanovyians arrived during the aftermath of the **Great Precursors-Faceless Ones War**, which had led to the extinction of the Precursors and the rise of the Faceless Ones. For 4,576 years, the Sabakanovyians remained unnoticed by the dominant forces of the dimension, as they settled and began rebuilding their civilization.
